# Triumph - Representing emotion

The goal of this project is to represent the Triumph emotion. The light pattern creates a sense of movement from the smallest cube to the largest cube. The initial cube is a twisted parallelepiped, which represents initial difficulty acheiving a goal. The final, largest cube is straight and square, which represents accomplishing a goal. The light color green was chosen because green represents growth, harmony, and energy.

## Sculpture

The paper sculpture was built using this [Template Maker](https://www.templatemaker.nl/en/) site and illustrator. I used the Cricuit Maker to cut the green base and the 3 cubes. The green base covers the ardiuno and breadboard.

I used foam board was a foundation for the whole project.

## [Code](/emotion_pattern_with_switches.ino)

I created a 6 step sequence for the lights. The flashing of the lights creates a sense of movement toward the largest cube. 

## Circuit

* 3 - 220ohm resistors
* 3 - Green LEDs
* 1 - Arduino UNO
* 1 - Switch

I created a wired button that allows for the 3 different light modes to be cycled through. The wired are all hidden with the excpetion of the wire for the button.

## Issues
* I initally planned to use yellow lights, but found the not bright enough to illuminate the largest cube. 
* Soldering the wires to the small button was challenging due to the small size.
